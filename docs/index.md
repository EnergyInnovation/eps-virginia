## Documentation

Documentation of source data, assumptions, and policy scenarios is available [here](https://github.com/Energy-Innovation/eps-virginia/raw/main/Virginia%20EPS%20Scenario%20Assumptions.pdf). Documentation of the model is available [here](https://us.energypolicy.solutions/docs/index.html).
